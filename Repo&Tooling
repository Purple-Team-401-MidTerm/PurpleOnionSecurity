Repo and Tooling

We decided to create an organization on Github. Everyone in the project has admin rights. This would be problamatic in a developer role but not for this project as there will be limited code written and very little risk to the MVP.

We meet as a group at 9am and talk about our plan for the day. We meet again at 430pm and go over any commits or issues we are having. We are a well rounded team and prefer to lean on and learn from one another with a singular goal of producing an outstanding product.

Trello is where we track our progress. However with the limited time and scope of the project it is of limited use. We update it as needed with new tasks and assignments.
